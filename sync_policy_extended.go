	AcceleratedFailback bool `json:"accelerated_failback"`

	// If 'copy', source files will be copied to the target cluster.  If 'sync', the target directory will be made an image of the source directory:  Files and directories that have been deleted on the source, have been moved within the target directory, or no longer match the selection criteria will be deleted from the target directory.

	ExpectedDataloss bool `json:"expected_dataloss"`

	// A file matching pattern, organized as an OR'ed set of AND'ed file criteria, for example ((a AND b) OR (x AND y)) used to define a set of files with specific properties.  Policies of type 'sync' cannot use 'path' or time criteria in their matching patterns, but policies of type 'copy' can use all listed criteria.
	FileMatchingPattern *SyncJobPolicyFileMatchingPattern `json:"file_matching_pattern"`

	// NOTE: This field should not be changed without the help of Isilon support.  Determines whether data is sent only through the subnet and pool specified in the \"source_network\" field.

	ForceInterface bool `json:"force_interface"`

	// This field is false if the policy is in its initial sync state and true otherwise.  Setting this field to false will reset the policy's sync state.

	LogRemovedFiles bool `json:"log_removed_files"`

	// User-assigned name of this sync policy.

	// This is the next time a job is scheduled to run for this policy in Unix epoch seconds.  This field is null if the job is not scheduled.
	NextRun int32 `json:"next_run,omitempty"`

	// Indicates if a password is set for accessing the target cluster. Password value is not shown with GET.
	PasswordSet bool `json:"password_set"`

	RestrictTargetNetwork bool `json:"restrict_target_network"`
